# Tutorial Name
There are a lot of different types of movements that can be implemented in a game. Point to click is often popular for strategy games, some RPGs, and many adventure games. In this tutorial you'll move a single character around the scene based on where the player clicks their mouse, having them dodge obstacles and alternate between two types of movements - walking and running. A Cinemachine virtual camera will be used to automatically keep the player in focus while they move around the level.
